Juan NNP O

has VBZ O
made VBN O
the DT O
right JJ O
decision NN O
to TO O
travel VB O
to TO O
the DT O
United NNP O

on IN O
Thursday NNP B-null
to TO O
affirm VB O
his PRP$ O
desire NN O
to TO O
be VB O
reunited VBN O
with IN O
his PRP$ O
son NN O
, , O
Elian NNP O

His PRP$ O
presence NN O
on IN O
American JJ O
soil NN O
is VBZ O
necessary JJ O
to TO O
dispel VB O
doubts NNS O
about IN O
his PRP$ O
fitness NN O
as IN O
a DT O
father NN O
_ NN O
raised VBD O
maliciously RB O
by IN O
Elian NNP O
's POS O
Miami NNP O
relatives NNS O
_ NN O
and CC O
to TO O
end VB O
speculation NN O
that IN O
he PRP O
is VBZ O
indifferent JJ O
about IN O
reclaiming VBG O
custody NN O
of IN O
his PRP$ O
son NN O

With IN O
Gonzalez NNP O
all DT O
but RB O
out RB O
of IN O
sight NN O
in IN O
Cuba NNP O
, , O
the DT O
relatives NNS O
have VBP O
had VBN O
a DT O
free JJ O
hand NN O
to TO O
distort VB O
the DT O
case NN O
with IN O
bogus JJ O
legal JJ O
arguments NNS O
and CC O
unsubstantiated JJ O
claims NNS O
that IN O
Elian NNP O
is VBZ O
afraid JJ O
to TO O
see VB O
his PRP$ O
father NN O
. . O


The DT O
relatives NNS O
are VBP O
obviously RB O
fond VBN O
of IN O
Elian NNP O
, , O
though IN O
their PRP$ O
judgment NN O
has VBZ O
clearly RB O
been VBN O
clouded VBN O
by IN O
their PRP$ O
animosity NN O
toward IN O
Fidel NNP O
Castro NNP O
, , O
the DT O
Cuban JJ O
leader NN O
. . O


Once IN O
Gonzalez NNP O
comes VBZ O
to TO O
the DT O
United NNP O
States NNPS O
_ NNP O
it PRP O
would MD O
be VB O
preferable JJ O
if IN O
he PRP O
went VBD O
to TO O
Miami NNP O
rather RB O
than IN O
to TO O
Washington NNP O
_ NNP O
only RB O
the DT O
most RBS O
obdurate JJ O
foes NNS O
of IN O
Castro NNP O
can MD O
argue VB O
that IN O
Elian NNP O
should MD O
not RB O
be VB O
reunited VBN O
with IN O
him PRP O
. . O


Gonzalez NNP O
's POS O
arrival NN O
should MD O
also RB O
help VB O
clear RB O
the DT O
way NN O
for IN O
the DT O
Justice NNP O
Department NNP O
to TO O
make VB O
arrangements NNS O
to TO O
transfer VB O
custody NN O
of IN O
the DT O
child NN O
. . O


The DT O
Miami NNP O
relatives NNS O
have VBP O
left VBN O
unclear JJ O
whether IN O
they PRP O
will MD O
willingly RB O
relinquish VB O
custody NN O
of IN O
Elian NNP O
, , O
and CC O
have VB O
done VBN O
their PRP$ O
best JJS O
to TO O
stir VB O
passions NNS O
against IN O
the DT O
Justice NNP O
Department NNP O
among IN O
Cuban JJ O
Americans NNS O
in IN O
South NNP O
Florida NNP O
. . O


In IN O
hopes NNS O
of IN O
trumping VBG O
the DT O
law NN O
, , O
they PRP O
have VBP O
unreasonably RB O
demanded VBN O
that IN O
a DT O
panel NN O
of IN O
child NN O
psychologists NNS O
determine VB O
Elian NNP O
's POS O
fate NN O
. . O


The DT O
best JJS O
outcome NN O
would MD O
be VB O
for IN O
the DT O
relatives NNS O
to TO O
turn VB O
Elian NNP O
over IN O
to TO O
his PRP$ O
father NN O
as RB O
soon RB O
as IN O
Gonzalez NNP O
arrives VBZ O
, , O
and CC O
to TO O
do VB O
so RB O
in IN O
a DT O
spirit NN O
of IN O
kinship NN O
that WDT O
makes VBZ O
the DT O
transition NN O
as RB O
smooth JJ O
as IN O
possible JJ O
for IN O
Elian NNP O
. . O


Once IN O
that DT O
happens VBZ O
, , O
Gonzalez NNP O
and CC O
Elian NNP O
, , O
though IN O
technically RB O
free JJ O
to TO O
return NN O
to TO O
Cuba NNP O
, , O
should MD O
remain VB O
here RB O
to TO O
await VB O
an DT O
appellate JJ O
court NN O
ruling NN O
on IN O
the DT O
case NN O
, , O
which WDT O
is VBZ O
expected VBN O
next JJ B-null
month NN I-null
. . O


But CC O
if IN O
the DT O
relatives NNS O
balk VBP O
, , O
the DT O
Justice NNP O
Department NNP O
should MD O
quickly RB O
revoke VB O
their PRP$ O
custody NN O
of IN O
the DT O
child NN O
and CC O
obtain VB O
a DT O
federal JJ O
court NN O
order NN O
instructing VBG O
them PRP O
and CC O
their PRP$ O
lawyers NNS O
to TO O
turn VB O
Elian NNP O
over RP O
to TO O
his PRP$ O
father NN O
. . O


The DT O
relatives NNS O
may MD O
be VB O
less RBR O
defiant JJ O
if IN O
they PRP O
are VBP O
held VBN O
in IN O
contempt NN O
of IN O
court NN O
. . O


If IN O
a DT O
court NN O
edict NN O
fails VBZ O
to TO O
compel VB O
compliance NN O
, , O
the DT O
Justice NNP O
Department NNP O
will MD O
have VB O
to TO O
consider VB O
sterner NN O
measures NNS O
, , O
for IN O
the DT O
relatives NNS O
will MD O
then RB O
be VB O
resisting VBG O
the DT O
rule NN O
of IN O
law NN O
as IN O
defined VBN O
by IN O
both PDT O
the DT O
department NN O
and CC O
the DT O
courts NNS O
. . O


But CC O
Washington NNP O
ought MD O
not RB O
to TO O
rush VB O
to TO O
take VB O
Elian JJ O
forcibly NN O
from IN O
the DT O
relatives NNS O
. . O


That DT O
course NN O
would MD O
be VB O
psychologically RB O
wounding JJ O
to TO O
the DT O
boy NN O
, , O
and CC O
could MD O
lead VB O
to TO O
a DT O
violent JJ O
confrontation NN O
with IN O
demonstrators NNS O
who WP O
gather VBP O
daily RB B-null
outside IN O
the DT O
relatives NNS O

home NN O

The DT O
government NN O
yields VBZ O
none NN O
of IN O
its PRP$ O
legal JJ O
or CC O
moral JJ O
authority NN O
in IN O
the DT O
case NN O
if IN O
it PRP O
gives VBZ O
the DT O
relatives NNS O
and CC O
their PRP$ O
supporters NNS O
time NN O
to TO O
reflect VB O
and CC O
to TO O
look VB O
for IN O
a DT O
gentler JJR O
resolution NN O

As IN O
a DT O
matter NN O
of IN O
law NN O
, , O
compassion NN O
and CC O
common JJ O
sense NN O
, , O
the DT O
government NN O
is VBZ O
entitled VBN O
to TO O
reunite VB O
Elian NNP O
with IN O
his PRP$ O
father NN O
, , O
and CC O
it PRP O
has VBZ O
the DT O
power NN O
to TO O
enforce VB O
that DT O
right NN O
, , O
despite IN O
the DT O
bluster NN O
of IN O
Miami NNP O

demagogic JJ O
political JJ O
leaders NNS O

But CC O
for IN O
now RB B-null

everyone NN O
involved VBN O
should MD O
be VB O
searching VBG O
for IN O
an DT O
amicable JJ O
ending NN O

Juan NNP O

by IN O
making VBG O

Those DT O

he PRP O

both DT O

the DT O
exploitation NN O

The DT O
question NN O
is VBZ O
who WP O
will MD O
Cubans NNPS O
believe VB O
? . O


The DT O
main JJ O
negative NN O
is VBZ O
the DT O
risk NN O
that IN O

If IN O

the DT O

The DT O

lose VB O
in IN O
the DT O
long JJ O
run NN O
by IN O
simply RB O
standing VBG O

At IN O
that DT O
point NN O
, , O
rather RB O
than IN O
go VB O
through IN O
the DT O
humiliation NN O
of IN O
backing VBG O
out RP O
of IN O
Kuwait NNP O
, , O
the DT O
Iraqis NNPS O
might MD O

to TO O

In IN O
that DT O
event NN O
, , O
Saddam NNP O

appears VBZ O
to TO O
have VB O
three CD O
choices NNS O

The DT O
first JJ O
would MD O
be VB O
to TO O
launch VB O
the DT O
much RB O
feared VBN O
direct JJ O
invasion NN O
of IN O
Saudi NNP O

hoping VBG O
to TO O
seize VB O
some DT O
Saudi JJ O

and CC O
improve VB O
his PRP$ O

position NN O

But CC O
that DT O
option NN O
is VBZ O
growing VBG O
less JJR O
and CC O
less RBR O
likely JJ O
as IN O
thousands NNS O
of IN O
American JJ O

Syrian JJ O
and CC O
Moroccan NNP O
forces NNS O
assemble VBP O
in IN O

Saudi NNP O
Arabia NNP O
to TO O
protect VB O
the DT O

The DT O
Saudis NNPS O
even RB O

48 CD O

virtually RB O
the DT O

the DT O

Saudi JJ O

The DT O

the DT O

said VBD O
over IN O
the DT B-null

The DT O
second JJ O
possibility NN O
would MD O
be VB O
to TO O
start VB O
a DT O

with IN O
Israel NNP O
, , O
in IN O
hopes NNS O
that IN O

in IN O
a DT O

against IN O
their PRP$ O
common JJ O
Israeli JJ O
enemy NN O

In IN O
such PDT O
an DT O
event NN O
, , O
Saddam NNP O

also RB O
might MD O
calculate VB O

the DT O
Saudis NNPS O
would MD O
be VB O
under IN O
pressure NN O
to TO O
kick VB O
out RP O
U.S. NNP O
troops NNS O
because RB O
of IN O
America NNP O

close JJ O

Iraq NNP O
could MD O
start VB O
hostilities NNS O
with IN O
Israel NNP O
either CC O
through IN O
a DT O

or CC O
by IN O

Israel NNP O
has VBZ O
publicly RB O
declared VBN O
that IN O
it PRP O
will MD O
respond VB O
to TO O

because IN O
it PRP O

army NN O
to TO O
take VB O

of IN O
Jordan NNP O

long JJ O

with IN O
Israel NNP O

Iraq NNP O

third JJ O
attack NN O
option NN O
would MD O
be VB O
to TO O
start VB O
an DT O
undeclared JJ O
war NN O
on IN O
the DT O
U.S. NNP O
and CC O
other JJ O
Western JJ O
nations NNS O
through IN O

Two CD O

Abu NNP O

And CC O
even RB O
terrorist JJ O

that WDT O

that IN O

They PRP O
are VBP O

being VBG O
allowed VBN O
to TO O
leave VB O

could MD O
become VB O
hostages NNS O

If IN O
Iraq NNP O
chooses VBZ O
a DT O
simple JJ O
war NN O
of IN O
nerves NNS O
and CC O
economic JJ O
attrition NN O
, , O
the DT O
Bush NNP O

that IN O

the DT O
effort NN O
against IN O
Iraq NNP O
and CC O
accept VB O
some DT O
deal NN O
from IN O
Saddam NNP O

But CC O
U.S. NNP O
officials NNS O
have VBP O
sized VBD O
up RP O
Saddam NNP O
Hussein NNP O
as IN O
a DT O
man NN O
who WP O
, , O
despite IN O
some DT O
recklessness NN O
, , O
will MD O
back VB O
down RP O
if IN O
he PRP O
must MD O
. . O


`` `` O
This DT O

a DT O

'' '' O
says VBZ O
one CD O
senior JJ O

The DT O
official NN O
adds VBZ O

though RB O

that IN O
`` `` O

then RB O

Thus RB O

whether IN O

The DT O

that IN O

The DT O
unpredictability NN O

the DT O

when WRB O
