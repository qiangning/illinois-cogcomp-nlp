One CD O
of IN O
the DT O

that IN O

Cuba NNP O

still RB O

can MD O
begin VB O
a DT O

That DT O

Those DT O

very RB O

he PRP O

both DT O
want VBP O

end VB O
the DT O
exploitation NN O

The DT O
question NN O
is VBZ O
who WP O
will MD O
Cubans NNPS O
believe VB O
? . O


The DT O
main JJ O
negative NN O
is VBZ O
the DT O
risk NN O
that IN O
the DT O

will MD O
persuade VB O

If IN O

then RB O
the DT O

the DT O

The DT O

it PRP O

the DT O

At IN O
that DT O

rather RB O

go VB O
through IN O
the DT O
humiliation NN O
of IN O

the DT O
Iraqis NNPS O

In IN O
that DT O

The DT O

that DT O

In IN O

Mr. NNP O

instead RB O
of IN O
the DT B-null
four CD I-null

he PRP O
originally RB O
considered VBD O

because RB O
of IN O
objections NNS O

some DT O

that IN O
four CD O

seemed VBD O
punitive JJ O

And CC O
when WRB O

about IN O

in IN O
a DT O

lasting VBG O
nearly RB B-null

the DT O

Finally RB O

when WRB O

Mr. NNP O

Saturday NNP B-null

The DT O

the DT O

The DT O

It PRP O

If IN O

The DT O

that IN O
